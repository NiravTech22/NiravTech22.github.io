        Hi everybody! My name is Karan. I'm in 12th grade, and Iâ€™m the vice president Auto Club for this year! I am thrilled to be part of the Auto Club team and am excited to meet and learn alongside every one of you. I enjoy playing soccer, swimming, and photography. Favorite car is the Lexus LFA (v10>>) I aspire to be an orthodontist, but love to express my love for cars through hobbies.
